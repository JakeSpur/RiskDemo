## How To Run

Make sure you are running the latest version of Node at this time (v6.4.0)

``` js
npm install
npm start
```

You should see the browser window pop open on port 3000

If you have an app already running on port 3000 either kill the process or alter the port number inside tools/devServer.js

## If I had more time

I would have added unit tests for my components, as it stands my 3hrs are up

Due to the time constraints I've used bootstrap for some basic styling
